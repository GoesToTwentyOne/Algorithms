# Backtracking Technique

## Overview
Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that explores all possible solutions to a computational problem. It traverses a search space to find all feasible solutions by systematically building candidates and rejecting those that fail to satisfy the problem's constraints or conditions. This approach is often used in problems involving finding paths, combinations, permutations, and more.

## Why Use Backtracking?
Backtracking is particularly useful in situations where the problem involves:

- Combinatorial problems such as permutations, combinations, subsets, etc.
- Constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku, N-Queens, graph coloring, etc.
- Exploring all possible solutions within a search space efficiently.

The primary advantage of using backtracking is its ability to systematically search for a solution without exhaustive iterations. It prunes branches of the search tree that won't lead to a valid solution, significantly reducing the computational load in search spaces.

## Structure
```txt
backtrack(state) {
  if solution_found(state) {
    --> add state to answer
    --> return
  }

  for all valid candidates {
    --> add candidate to state
    --> backtrack(state)
    --> remove candidate from state
  }
}
```
## Complexity
The time and space complexity of backtracking algorithms can vary based on the problem being solved. In the worst-case scenario, the time complexity can be exponential since it may need to explore all possible paths. The space complexity is generally related to the depth of the recursion or the size of the search space.

## Implementation
Backtracking algorithms are often implemented using recursive techniques, maintaining the state and exploring different options at each step, gradually backtracking when a solution is found or when no feasible options are available. It typically involves the following steps:

1. Identifying the problem as a suitable candidate for backtracking.
2. Defining the problem constraints and conditions.
3. Implementing the recursive solution by:
    - Making a choice.
    - Checking for feasibility based on the problem's constraints.
    - Moving to the next step or backtracking if the choice doesn't lead to a valid solution.
    - Marking the solution if found or discarding it if it doesn’t meet the problem criteria.

## Example
An example of a simple backtracking problem is the "N-Queens" problem, where the challenge is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
