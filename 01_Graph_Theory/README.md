## Variations in Graphs
Graph theory deals with various types of graphs, each having its own properties and characteristics. In this article, we will discuss some of the common variations in graphs.

## Directed and Undirected Graphs
A directed graph, also known as a digraph, is a graph in which each edge has a direction. That is, if there is an edge from vertex A to vertex B, it does not necessarily imply that there is an edge from vertex B to vertex A. In contrast, an undirected graph is a graph in which each edge is bidirectional. That is, if there is an edge between vertex A and vertex B, there is also an edge between vertex B and vertex A.

## Weighted and Unweighted Graphs
A weighted graph is a graph in which each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. The weight can represent the distance, cost, or any other attribute associated with the edge. In contrast, an unweighted graph is a graph in which each edge has no associated weight.

## Connected and Disconnected Graphs
A connected graph is a graph in which there exists a path between every pair of vertices. That is, there are no isolated vertices in a connected graph. In contrast, a disconnected graph is a graph in which there are one or more pairs of vertices that do not have a path between them.

## Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs
A cyclic graph is a graph that contains at least one cycle. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, and does not repeat any other vertices or edges. In contrast, an acyclic graph is a graph that does not contain any cycles.

## Bipartite Graphs
A bipartite graph is a graph in which the vertices can be divided into two sets, such that no two vertices in the same set are connected by an edge. That is, all edges connect vertices from one set to the other set.

## Complete Graphs
A complete graph is a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. That is, there are no isolated vertices in a complete graph.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, graph theory deals with various types of graphs, each having its own properties and characteristics. Some of the common variations in graphs include directed and undirected graphs, weighted and unweighted graphs, connected and disconnected graphs, cyclic and acyclic graphs, bipartite graphs, and complete graphs. Understanding the properties of different types of graphs is essential for solving problems related to data structures and algorithms.

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Graph Theory
In graph theory, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a type of directed graph that does not contain any cycles. DAGs have many applications in computer science, including in scheduling algorithms, task dependencies, and genealogical relationships.

## Properties of DAGs
* **A DAG has the following properties:**

* **It is directed:** Each edge in the graph has a direction from one vertex to another.

* **It is acyclic:** There are no cycles or loops in the graph.

* **It can be topologically sorted:** The vertices of the graph can be arranged in a linear order such that for every edge (u, v), u comes before v in the order.

## Applications of DAGs
DAGs have many applications in computer science, including:

* **Scheduling Algorithms:** DAGs are used to model task dependencies in scheduling algorithms. Each task is represented by a vertex in the graph, and the edges represent the dependencies between tasks.

* **Genealogical Relationships:** DAGs are used to model genealogical relationships between individuals. Each individual is represented by a vertex in the graph, and the edges represent the parent-child relationships.

* **Data Flow Analysis:** DAGs are used to model data flow in computer programs. Each variable is represented by a vertex in the graph, and the edges represent the flow of data between variables.

## Topological Sorting
Topological sorting is a process of arranging the vertices of a DAG in a linear order such that for every edge (u, v), u comes before v in the order. Topological sorting can be done using a depth-first search algorithm or a breadth-first search algorithm.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a type of directed graph that does not contain any cycles. DAGs have many properties and applications, including in scheduling algorithms, genealogical relationships, and data flow analysis. DAGs can be topologically sorted, which is a process of arranging the vertices of the graph in a linear order. Understanding DAGs is essential for solving problems related to data structures and algorithms.

## Key Questions:

## A connected planar graph having 6 vertices, 7 edges contains _____________ regions.Hint : search for euler equation for vertices edge relationship

For a connected planar graph with v vertices, e edges, and f regions, the Euler's formula states that:

v - e + f = 2

Here, we have a connected planar graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges. Let's assume that the graph has f regions.

Using the Euler's formula, we can calculate the number of regions as:

f = 2 + e - v
= 2 + 7 - 6
= 3

Therefore, the connected planar graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges contains 3 regions.


## What is the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph having 10 vertices?
In a bipartite graph, the vertices are partitioned into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. Let's assume that the bipartite graph with 10 vertices has x vertices in one partition and y vertices in the other partition. Since the graph is bipartite, we know that every edge connects a vertex in one partition to a vertex in the other partition.

Therefore, the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with 10 vertices is achieved when there are 5 vertices in each partition, and every vertex in one partition is adjacent to every vertex in the other partition. This gives us:

x = 5 and y = 5
Maximum number of edges = x * y = 5 * 5 = 25

Therefore, the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph having 10 vertices is 25.


## What is the number of edges present in a complete graph having n vertices?
In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. Therefore, the number of edges present in a complete graph having n vertices can be calculated as follows:

First, we choose any two vertices from the n vertices, which can be done in nC2 ways (i.e., n choose 2). Since each such pair of vertices is connected by an edge, there are nC2 edges in a complete graph with n vertices.

Using the formula for combinations, we have:

nC2 = n! / (2! * (n - 2)!)
= (n * (n - 1)) / 2

Therefore, the number of edges present in a complete graph having n vertices is (n * (n - 1)) / 2.


## In a simple graph, the number of edges is equal to twice the sum of the degrees of the vertices
In a simple graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to that vertex. The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph. This statement is known as the Handshake Lemma or Handshaking Theorem.

To see why this is true, consider that each edge in a graph is incident to two vertices. Therefore, each edge contributes 2 to the sum of the degrees of the vertices. Thus, the total sum of degrees is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph.

Formally, if G is a simple graph with n vertices and e edges, then the Handshake Lemma states that:

sum of degrees of all vertices in G = 2e

We can also express this formula in terms of the average degree d of the vertices, which is the sum of the degrees divided by the number of vertices. Then, we have:

sum of degrees of all vertices in G = nd = 2e

which implies that:

e = nd / 2

This formula tells us that the number of edges in a simple graph is directly proportional to the average degree of the vertices.


## All paths and cyclic graphs are bipartite graphs.
This statement is not true.

A bipartite graph is a graph in which the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, such that all edges connect a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.

A path is a simple graph in which the vertices are connected by a single chain of edges. A path with an odd number of vertices is not bipartite, since it is not possible to divide the vertices into two sets of equal size. For example, the path graph with 3 vertices is not bipartite, since every possible partition of the vertices into two sets results in a pair of adjacent vertices being in the same set.

A cyclic graph is a graph that contains at least one cycle. A cyclic graph can be bipartite or not, depending on the structure of the graph. For example, the cycle graph with 4 vertices is bipartite, since the vertices can be divided into two sets {1,3} and {2,4}. However, the cycle graph with 3 vertices is not bipartite, since it is not possible to divide the vertices into two sets of equal size without adjacent vertices being in the same set.

In summary, not all paths and cyclic graphs are bipartite graphs.


## All trees with n vertices consists of n-1 edges.
This statement is true.

A tree is an undirected graph that is connected and acyclic. In other words, a tree is a graph in which there is a unique path between any two vertices, and there are no cycles (i.e., there is no sequence of edges that begins and ends at the same vertex).

To prove that every tree with n vertices consists of n-1 edges, we can use induction on the number of vertices n.

Base case: For n=1, a tree with one vertex consists of zero edges, which is equal to n-1.

Inductive step: Assume that every tree with k vertices consists of k-1 edges, where k is some integer greater than or equal to 1. We will show that every tree with k+1 vertices also consists of k edges.

Let T be a tree with k+1 vertices. Since T is connected and acyclic, there must be at least one vertex v in T that has degree 1 (i.e., there is exactly one edge incident to v). If we remove v and its incident edge from T, we obtain a tree T' with k vertices, since removing a degree-1 vertex and its incident edge cannot create a cycle. By the inductive hypothesis, T' consists of k-1 edges.

When we add v and its incident edge back to T', we add one edge and one vertex, so the total number of edges in T is k-1+1=k. Therefore, every tree with n vertices consists of n-1 edges.
