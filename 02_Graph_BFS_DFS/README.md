Introduction to BFS and DFS Repository

Welcome to the Graph Algorithms Repository! This repository contains implementations and explanations for two fundamental graph traversal algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). These algorithms are widely used for exploring and analyzing graphs in computer science and data structures.

## Introduction to BFS and DFS

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore and analyze graphs. It starts at a specified source node and explores the graph by visiting all its neighbors before moving on to their children and grandchildren. Key points about BFS:

- BFS uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to visit.
- It guarantees the shortest path to a destination in an unweighted graph.
- BFS is often used to find the connected components of a graph.

For a detailed implementation and example of BFS, check out the `bfs.cpp` file in this repository.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is another graph traversal algorithm that explores the graph by going as deep as possible along a branch before backtracking. Key points about DFS:

- DFS uses a stack (or recursion) to keep track of nodes to visit.
- It can be used to detect cycles in a graph.
- DFS may not guarantee the shortest path to a destination.

For a detailed implementation and example of DFS, check out the `dfs.cpp` file in this repository.

## Repository Contents

- `bfs.cpp`: C++ implementation of the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
- `dfs.cpp`: C++ implementation of the Depth-First Search algorithm.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository to your local machine and run the provided C++ implementations to see BFS and DFS in action. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.

To run BFS:
```bash
g++ bfs.cpp -o bfs
./bfs
```

To run DFS:
```bash
g++ dfs.cpp -o dfs
./dfs
```
