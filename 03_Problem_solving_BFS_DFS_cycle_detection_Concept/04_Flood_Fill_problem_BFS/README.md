Flood Fill Problem Definition:

The flood fill problem is a fundamental algorithmic challenge in computer science and image processing. It involves the exploration and manipulation of a multi-dimensional grid or image, where the objective is to visit, analyze, or modify all connected cells or pixels within a specific region. The flood fill problem can be formally defined as follows:

Given:
1. A multi-dimensional array or grid, typically represented as a matrix, where each element corresponds to a cell or pixel.
2. A starting cell or pixel within the array.
3. A target value or condition, often denoting a specific color, state, or characteristic that needs to be applied to or identified within the connected region.
4. Optionally, a set of constraints or rules that dictate the allowable transitions between neighboring cells, such as movements restricted to up, down, left, right, or diagonally.

Objective:
To systematically explore and traverse the grid, starting from the initial cell, and perform the following tasks depending on the context:

1. Area Filling: Change the state, color, or content of cells within a connected region to match the target value.
2. Region Identification: Determine the extent and properties of the connected region containing the starting cell.
3. Pathfinding: Find a path from the starting cell to a specific destination cell while avoiding obstacles or following predefined rules.
4. Connected Component Analysis: Identify and analyze clusters or components of connected cells in the grid.
5. Recursive Exploration: Recursively process neighboring cells, extending the exploration to adjacent cells and maintaining connectivity within the region.

The flood fill problem arises in various applications, such as image editing, maze solving, graph theory, and gaming, and it serves as a foundation for solving a wide range of graph traversal and region-based manipulation challenges. The specific requirements and constraints may vary depending on the problem context, but the fundamental goal remains the same: to efficiently explore and operate within connected regions in a given grid.
