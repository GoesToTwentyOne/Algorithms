# Factorial Knapsack Problem

## Definition
The factorial knapsack problem is a variation of the classic knapsack problem where an additional factor or constraint is introduced. In this problem, apart from the usual limitations on the total weight that the knapsack can carry, there is an additional restriction based on the factorial of the number of items selected.

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, the goal is to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items while ensuring that the total weight does not exceed the capacity of the knapsack and the factorial of the number of selected items stays within a specified limit.
**Problem Definition:**

The factorial knapsack problem is a variant of the classical knapsack problem in combinatorial optimization. In this scenario, the goal is to maximize the value of items chosen to be placed in a knapsack while considering the factorial of their weights, rather than the linear sum of weights. The objective is to determine the combination of items that maximizes the total value, taking into account the factorials of their respective weights, without exceeding the capacity of the knapsack.

**Problem Parameters:**

- **Input:**
  - \(n\) items, each with its weight \(w_i\) and value \(v_i\).
  - Knapsack capacity \(W\).

- **Output:**
  - The maximum value that can be achieved by selecting a combination of items considering the factorial of their weights without surpassing the knapsack's capacity.

**Example Simulation:**

Consider a scenario with 4 items with varying weights and values:

| Item | Weight | Value |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1    | 2      | 10    |
| 2    | 3      | 7     |
| 3    | 5      | 15    |
| 4    | 7      | 12    |

Let's say the capacity of the knapsack is 10.

The factorial knapsack problem involves determining the optimal selection of items that maximizes the total value, considering the factorial of their weights while ensuring the total weight does not exceed the capacity.

To solve this problem, the brute-force method involves examining all possible combinations of items within the capacity constraint and computing the total value for each combination considering the factorial of their weights.

For example, the combinations of items (1, 3) and (2, 4) might yield different total values when considering the factorials of their weights. Therefore, one needs to calculate the factorial of the weights, factor it into the knapsack problem's value calculation, and compare it with other combinations.

The solution might involve dynamic programming techniques or heuristics to optimize the search for the most valuable combination of items within the knapsack's capacity, factoring in the factorial of their weights.

This simulation showcases the complexity of the factorial knapsack problem and the necessity for efficient algorithms to solve it, especially as the number of items and their weights increases.

## Complexity Analysis
The factorial knapsack problem is known to be NP-hard. The time complexity of solving this problem using dynamic programming is usually exponential, dependent on the number of items and the factorials involved. The dynamic programming solution involves constructing a multi-dimensional array to store and compute intermediate results, which can lead to high time and space complexity.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution for the factorial knapsack problem is typically in the order of O(n * W * (n!)), where:
- n is the number of items,
- W is the capacity of the knapsack,
- (n!) represents the factorial constraint.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also high, as it requires a multi-dimensional array to store the intermediate results, typically in the order of O(n * W).

## Other Considerations
- **Optimization Techniques**: To address the high time complexity, various optimization techniques like memoization, pruning, or heuristics may be applied.
- **Approximation Algorithms**: Due to the NP-hard nature of the factorial knapsack problem, approximation algorithms might be employed to find near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time.
- **Real-World Applications**: While the factorial knapsack problem might seem theoretical, it finds applications in resource allocation, finance, and various industries where constraints related to factorial quantities are prevalent.
