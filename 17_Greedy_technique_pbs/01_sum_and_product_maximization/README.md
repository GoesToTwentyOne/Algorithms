Certainly! The problem of maximizing the sum and product using the Greedy Technique can be framed in the following way:

**Problem:**
Given an array of positive integers, find two non-negative integers from the array such that their sum and product are maximized.

**Note:**
To solve this problem using the Greedy Technique, we can sort the array in descending order. By doing so, we aim to pick the two largest numbers in the array, as a larger number multiplied by another large number typically results in a higher product and sum.
